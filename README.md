# Plumbing-Tools-Store-Management-System
Plumbing Tools Store Management System is a Windows forms application designed for a local plumbing tools store owner to help him manage his small business, track his bills, track his products' amount and shortage, and print crystal reports for every successful purchase.

The User in the application can add/edit/delete Products and suppliers (from which he buys his products), track every product he bought and which supplier he had bought from with the exact amount and date, and extra information he might need later.

The user also keeps track of every product he sells, he can print receipts for every bill containing different sold products.
He can also add a discount to a bill if he wants/needs to do so.

In each product/supplier/bill page he has different ways of searching for the exact item/items he wants either by name/date.
Finally, he can add other users (if needed) to the system so they can also log in and use it.

We designed the application using C# Windows Forms, LINQ, Entity Framework, and Microsoft SQL Server
